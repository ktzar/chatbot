# Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot that connects to an IRC server, one or multiple channels and waits for private messages to start interacting with users.
At the moment it's very simple and only includes a few variations and randomised answers based on cues from the incoming messages.

## TODO
- .Env file to specify server, nick, and channels to join
- Conversation tree with cues to leave a specific node and go to the next one.
